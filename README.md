Etherium Miner Created By/For A Non-coder

Goal:  Create a single laptop PC dedicated crypto miner (It may be slow, but who cares?)

Hardware:
PC = Dell A4 Laptop
Video Card = AMD A4-6210 APU with AMD Radeon R3 Graphics 

Software:
OS = Windows 10 (No Proxy)
App = NiceHash Legacy 1.8.1.1
3rd Party App = ccminer.exe
Apps and all app recommended AMD drivers installed.


Issues or Potential Issues:
1.  Algorythms for benchmarking that enable the apps to mine do not make appearance within the app as indicated in instructions.
2.  Assuming algos are located, the app doesn't allow for manual entry, seeking remedy.


Questions: 
1. Is the problem that I have a graphics card for which there are NO algos?
2. Procedural/syntax error?
3. What am I doing incorrectly?
